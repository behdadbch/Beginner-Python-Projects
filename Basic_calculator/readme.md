# Basic Calculator

## üñ© Description

The **Basic Calculator** is a simple command-line application that performs basic arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The calculator takes user input for two numbers and an operator, then displays the result.

## üß∞ Key Concepts Covered

- Functions and Code Organization
- User Input (`input()` function)
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Exception Handling (`try`, `except`)
- Arithmetic Operations
- Basic Data Types (`int`, `float`, `str`)

## üöÄ How to Run the Calculator

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Access to a command-line interface (CLI) or terminal.

### Steps

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd basic_calculator
Run the calculator:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
üìñ Usage Instructions

Upon running the calculator, you will be prompted to:

Enter the first number.
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /).
Enter the second number.
The calculator will then display the result of the operation.

Example:
mathematica
Copy code
Enter the first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter the second number: 5
Result: 10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
üõ†Ô∏è Code Overview

The application is structured with a main function and separate functions for each arithmetic operation:

add(a, b): Returns the sum of a and b.
subtract(a, b): Returns the difference of a and b.
multiply(a, b): Returns the product of a and b.
divide(a, b): Returns the quotient of a divided by b.
calculate(a, operator, b): Calls the appropriate function based on the operator.
Modules Used
sys: For system-specific parameters and functions (not used in this version but useful for future enhancements).

Code Explanation and Best Practices
1. Modular Functions

Arithmetic Functions: Separate functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) make the code reusable and easier to maintain.
calculate(a, operator, b): Centralizes the operation selection logic, making it easy to extend with more operators in the future.
2. User Input Handling

Input Validation:
Numbers: Uses float() conversion to handle both integers and decimals.
Operator: Checks if the operator is one of the accepted symbols.
Graceful Exit: Allows the user to quit by entering 'q' when prompted for the first number.
Exception Handling:
ValueError: Catches invalid numerical inputs.
ZeroDivisionError: Handles division by zero in the divide function.
3. User Experience

Clear Instructions: Prompts guide the user on what is expected at each step.
Result Display: Shows the full expression and the result for clarity.
Loop Control: Allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.
4. Code Readability

Comments and Docstrings: Functions include docstrings that explain their purpose.
Consistent Naming: Variables and functions have descriptive names.
Whitespace and Indentation: Follows Python's standard for readability.
5. Extensibility

Easy to Add Features: The structure allows for additional operations (e.g., exponentiation) to be added with minimal changes.
Modular Design: Separating logic into functions makes future modifications straightforward.
Enhancements and Extensions
Consider adding the following features to enhance the calculator:

Additional Operations: Implement modulus (%), exponentiation (**), or floor division (//).
Parentheses Handling: Allow users to input expressions with parentheses and parse them accordingly.
Input History: Keep a history of calculations performed during the session.
Error Messages: Provide more detailed error messages for invalid inputs.
GUI Version: Create a graphical user interface using Tkinter or another library.
Testing the Calculator
Valid Inputs: Test calculations with valid numbers and operators.
Invalid Inputs: Enter invalid numbers (e.g., letters) and operators to ensure errors are handled gracefully.
Division by Zero: Attempt to divide by zero to see if the appropriate error message is displayed.
Exiting the Program: Test the exit functionality by entering 'q' when prompted.
