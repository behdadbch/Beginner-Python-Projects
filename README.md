# Python Projects for Beginners

Welcome to the Python Projects for Beginners repository! This collection is designed to help beginners dive into Python programming through a variety of hands-on projects. Each project aims to teach core concepts, help new learners gain practical experience, and build confidence in writing Python code.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by projects, each in its own folder with a clear and descriptive name. Each project folder contains:

README.md: A detailed explanation of the project, including objectives, instructions, and key concepts covered.
main.py: The main Python file to execute the project.
requirements.txt (if necessary): A list of required Python packages for the project.
Additional files as needed, such as data files or assets.
## üìù Projects

### Number Guessing Game
A simple game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The computer provides hints if the guess is too high or too low.
Key Concepts: Variables, loops, conditionals, user input, random module.
### To-Do List Application
A command-line application that allows users to add, remove, and view tasks in a to-do list. The list is saved to a file so that it persists across sessions.
Key Concepts: File handling, lists, functions, string manipulation.
### Basic Calculator
A calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.
Key Concepts: Functions, conditionals, user input, arithmetic operations.
### Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
A simple command-line game where the user plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
Key Concepts: Randomness, conditionals, loops.
### Password Generator
A program that generates a random password based on user-defined criteria (length, inclusion of special characters, numbers, etc.).
Key Concepts: String manipulation, loops, user input, random module.
### Weather Info Fetcher
A program that fetches the current weather for a given city using an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and displays it to the user.
Key Concepts: HTTP requests, APIs, JSON handling, error handling.
### Simple Quiz Game
A multiple-choice quiz game where the user answers questions, and their score is displayed at the end.
Key Concepts: Data structures (lists/dictionaries), loops, conditionals, functions.
### Currency Converter
A program that converts an amount of money from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates fetched from an API.
Key Concepts: APIs, JSON handling, user input, arithmetic operations.
More projects will be added regularly!

### Hangman Game
   - A classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a secret word one letter at a time.
   - **Key Concepts**: String manipulation, lists, loops, conditionals, functions, random module.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
    - A command-line implementation of the classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game.
    - **Key Concepts**: Data structures, functions, control flow, game logic.
