### Code Explanation and Best Practices
1. Modular Functions

get_computer_choice(): Handles the logic for randomly selecting the computer's choice. It enhances readability and modularity.
determine_winner(player_choice, computer_choice): Contains the logic for determining the winner, making the main loop cleaner and focused on user interaction.
2. User Input Handling

Choice Validation: Checks if the player's input is a valid option (1-3). If not, it raises a ValueError, which is caught to provide feedback.
Loop for Replay: After each game, asks the player if they want to play again, creating a continuous gameplay experience.
3. Randomness

random.choice(): Uses the random module to select the computer's choice, demonstrating the use of randomness in games.
4. User Experience

Clear Prompts: Guides the player through the choices, ensuring they know how to interact with the game.
Feedback Messages: Displays the choices made by both the player and the computer, along with the result of the round.
5. Code Readability

Comments and Docstrings: Each function has a docstring that describes its purpose, improving maintainability.
Consistent Naming: Uses descriptive names for functions and variables.
6. Error Handling

Input Validation: Catches invalid input types and ranges, preventing crashes and providing a better user experience.
