### Code Explanation and Best Practices
1. Data Structures

List of Dictionaries: Questions are stored as a list of dictionaries, each containing the question text, options, and correct answer. This structure allows for easy management and scalability.
2. Functions

run_quiz(questions): Handles the quiz flow, iterating over each question and collecting user input.
main(): Sets up the quiz data and calls run_quiz().
3. User Input Handling

Input Validation: Ensures the user enters a valid option (a, b, c, or d). Provides feedback if the input is invalid.
4. User Experience

Clear Prompts: Displays questions and options in a clear format.
Feedback Messages: Provides immediate feedback after each answer (Correct/Incorrect).
5. Scoring System

Score Calculation: Keeps track of the user's correct answers and calculates the percentage score at the end.
