### Code Explanation and Best Practices
1. Modular Functions

get_weather(city, api_key): Encapsulates the logic for making the API request and handling the response. This modular design improves code organization.
2. API Integration

Requests Library: Utilizes the requests library to make HTTP GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, fetching weather data in a structured format.
3. JSON Handling

Data Parsing: Retrieves and extracts relevant data (temperature, humidity, weather description) from the JSON response.
4. User Input Handling

City Input: Prompts the user for the city name, with an option to exit the application.
Error Handling: Checks the API response status code to determine if the request was successful.
5. User Experience

Clear Prompts: Guides the user through entering their API key and city name.
Formatted Output: Displays the weather information in a clear and readable format.
